      <p class = "paragraph" > After an extremely successful first book drive, we'd like to thank everyone who donated and helped make it happen, and we are excited to announce that we are now running our second book drive! We are collecting books from July 21st to August 5th. Any and all books will be excepted, but children's books are especially helpful. All donations will go to Rochester Refugee, a non-profit organization providing affordable housing and other services for immigrant families. Our donations will help these families learn English and feel welcome in Rochester. 
      To donate, email writerochester@gmail.com, and we will either inform you what addresses you can drop off your books at, or arrange for your books to be picked up! </p>
