      <p> WriteRochester is a student-led community organization dedicated to educating and empowering Rochester city youth and combating educational inequity. We host book drives, teach writing workshops, and hold projects/contests to help children benefit from the literary arts. WriteRochester also uses the power of writing to advocate for our local government to improve opportunities in education throughout Rochester and we encourage others to do the same. </p>
